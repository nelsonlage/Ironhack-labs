-- 1. In the table actor, what last names are not repeated? For example if you would sort the data in the table actor by last_name, you would 
-- see that there is Christian Arkoyd, Kirsten Arkoyd, and Debbie Arkoyd. These three actors have the same last name. So we do not want to include this last
-- name in our output. Last name "Astaire" is present only one time with actor "Angelina Astaire", hence we would want this in our output list.
SELECT last_name AS unique_last_name
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;

-- 2. Which last names appear more than once? We would use the same logic as in the previous question but this time we want to include
-- the last names of the actors where the last name was present more than once
SELECT last_name AS common_last_name
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- 3. Using the rental table, find out how many rentals were processed by each employee.
SELECT
  staff_id,
  COUNT(*) AS num_rentals
FROM rental
GROUP BY staff_id;

-- 4. Using the film table, find out how many films were released.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM film;

-- 5. Using the film table, find out how many films there are of each rating.
SELECT
  rating,
  COUNT(*) AS num_films
FROM film
GROUP BY rating;

-- 6. What is the mean length of the film for each rating type. Round off the average lengths to two decimal places
SELECT
  rating,
  ROUND(AVG(length), 2) AS avg_length
FROM film
GROUP BY rating;

-- 7. Which kind of movies (rating) have a mean duration of more than two hours?
SELECT
  rating,
  ROUND(AVG(length), 2) AS avg_length
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
HAVING avg_length > 120;
